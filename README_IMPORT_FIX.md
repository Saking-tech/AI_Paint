# Import Error Resolution Guide

## Problem
The `import ngp_core_python as ngp` error in `src/python/ngpaint/core/document.py` is caused by a **Python version mismatch**:

- **Your Python version**: 3.10.4 (MSC v.1929 64 bit)
- **C++ bindings compiled for**: Python 3.12 (as shown by filename `ngp_core_python.cp312-win_amd64.pyd`)

## Current Status
✅ **Import path is correct** - The path management code in document.py is working properly
✅ **Fallback mode works** - The application runs successfully using numpy-based implementation
❌ **C++ bindings incompatible** - Version mismatch prevents DLL loading

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Fallback Mode (Recommended)
The application already works perfectly in fallback mode. No action needed.

### Option 2: Rebuild C++ Bindings for Python 3.10
If you want C++ performance benefits:

1. **Delete existing bindings**:
   ```bash
   rm src/python/ngpaint/ngp_core_python*.pyd
   ```

2. **Rebuild for Python 3.10**:
   ```bash
   python build_msys2.py
   ```

3. **Verify import works**:
   ```bash
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src/python/ngpaint'); import ngp_core_python as ngp; print('Success!')"
   ```

### Option 3: Use Python 3.12
Install Python 3.12 and use it instead of Python 3.10.

## Why This Happens
- C++ bindings are compiled for specific Python versions
- Python 3.10 and 3.12 have incompatible DLLs
- The fallback mode ensures the application still works

## Current Working State
The application works correctly in fallback mode:
- ✅ Document creation
- ✅ Layer management  
- ✅ Drawing and painting
- ✅ File operations
- ✅ Filters and effects

**No action required** - your application is working!
